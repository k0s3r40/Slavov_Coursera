### Overview
This project is part of the Week 1 Assessment for the course "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments" offered by the University of Colorado Boulder. It includes a series of functions implemented in C to perform statistical analysis on an array of data.

#### Implemented Functions
- [x] main(): The main entry point for the program.
- [x] print_statistics(): Prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
- [x] print_array(): Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen.
- [x] find_median(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value.
- [x] find_mean(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean.
- [x] find_maximum(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum.
- [x] find_minimum(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum.
- [x] sort_array(): Sorts the array from largest to smallest. The zeroth element is the largest value, and the last element (n-1) is the smallest value.
